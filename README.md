Use [SimSim](https://github.com/dsmelov/simsim/blob/master/Release/SimSim_latest.zip?raw=true) to explore application folders while developing for iOS, watchOS or tvOS. SimSim is a free and open source replacement for SimPholders and there will be no charges in the future.
Works without any problems with Xcode 8! :)
